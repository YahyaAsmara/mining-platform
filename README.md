# Advanced Mining Operations Platform (Concept)

> ⚠️ **Project Status**: This is a conceptual project - not yet implemented. This README outlines the planned features and architecture.

## Overview

A comprehensive digital platform for managing real-world mining operations - from ore extraction to processing. Includes equipment monitoring, geological analysis, safety systems, and operational optimization.

## Planned Features

### Core Operations
- **Equipment tracking**: Excavators, trucks, drills, conveyor systems
- **Geological mapping**: 3D terrain modeling and ore deposit visualization  
- **Production monitoring**: Real-time extraction rates and processing metrics
- **Safety systems**: Environmental monitoring, worker safety alerts
- **Inventory management**: Material tracking from extraction to shipment

### Technologies (Proposed)

**Frontend**: React, Three.js (3D mine visualization), D3.js (data charts)
**Backend**: Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis
**IoT Integration**: Sensor data collection from mining equipment
**GIS**: Geographic Information Systems for site mapping
**Analytics**: Machine learning for predictive maintenance
